# Module 5 - Work Day Planner Challenge
## Websites:
* Deployed app: [Work Day Planner](https://iamjoyfulgirl.github.io/) ðŸ”— TODO
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iamjoyfulgirl/work-day-scheduler)
## Description: 
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of their work day.

## Application Functionality:
When the application is launched, the current date is shown at the top of the page. When the user scrolls down, the user can see time blocks from 9 AM to 5 PM. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. The user can click into a time block and enter an event. When the save button is clicked for a time block, the event text is saved in local storage and can be retrieved across browser sessions. 

## Features
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Moment.js
